Background of Enterprise
Drac Furniture Limited is a small retail/furniture-making company that specializes in the production and sale of furniture and accessories. They operate only a walk-in store and can only manage the needs of local customers. The company, however, wants to expand both physically and online to be able to accommodate its expanding customer base and improve operational efficiency. Drac Furniture wants to make use of cloud technology to enhance its IT setup.

Current IT Setup
Drac Furniture's current IT setup is basically non-existent, aside from the email services provided by their internet service provider, Drac Furniture has no IT setup.

Recommendations

1. Contrast of Cloud vs Non-cloud Solutions for Each Aspect of the Infrastructure
a. Email Services:
NON-CLOUD: Drac Furniture can continue using email services provided by their Internet Service Provider (ISP), which is cost effective for the business, but it lacks improved productivity and collaboration features.

CLOUD: Transferring email services to a cloud-based provider, such as Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, boosts collaboration, security, and growth. Cloud-based email solutions provide a professional email domain, connection with other cloud services, and robust spam filtering.

b. Website Hosting:

NON-CLOUD: With a new website hosted locally, Drac Furniture can get online. This option gives complete server management and may work for low-traffic websites.

CLOUD: Websites hosted on cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) benefit from increased scalability, availability, and accessibility on a global scale. It lets the business handle more data during busy times and improves service for customers in different parts of the world.



c. File Storage and Sharing:

NON-CLOUD: Drac Furniture can hire someone to develop an on-premises file storage system. This strategy offers direct control over the data and may be appropriate for firms with specific security and regulatory requirements.

2. Recommendation for Each Aspect of the Infrastructure

a. Email Services:
Recommendation: Switch to cloud-based email service.

Service Level: The organization does not have an established software ecosystem and the needed productivity capabilities, so choose Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace as your cloud-based productivity solution.

Deployment Type: Choose a SaaS deployment strategy to remove the burden of managing, maintaining, and securing your email infrastructure.

b. Website Hosting:
Recommendation: The website hosting should be moved to a cloud provider.

Service Level: Use a managed cloud hosting solution like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for simple deployment and automatic scalability.

Deployment Type: Choose a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) deployment model to delegate infrastructure administration so that you can concentrate on application development.

c. File Storage and Sharing:
Recommendation: Take advantage of cloud storage services to make your data more accessible and scalable.

Service Level: Choose a trusted cloud storage service like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, based on the business's chosen ecosystem and needs.

Deployment Type: Make use of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) deployment strategy so that you may use the provider's infrastructure and profit from frequent upgrades and maintenance.


3. Justification for Each Final Recommendation

a. Email Services:

Advanced collaboration tools, improved security, and scalability are all benefits of cloud-based email systems. By switching to a reputable provider's SaaS service, you'll have access to the latest email features without worrying about infrastructure upkeep and security.

b. Website Hosting: When you move your website hosting to the cloud, you get scaling, high uptime, and global reach. It helps ensure users have a smooth experience even when there is a lot of traffic. The recommended PaaS distribution model makes it easier to handle technology, so the business can focus on building and growing its website.

c. File Storage and Sharing:
Cloud storage services enhance data accessibility and collaboration while removing the danger of data loss due to local hardware failure. The suggested SaaS deployment model reduces maintenance efforts and offers regular updates to improve security and feature sets.
